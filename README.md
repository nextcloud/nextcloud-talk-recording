# Nextcloud Talk Recording Server

This is the official recording server to be used with Nextcloud Talk (https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed).

It requires the standalone signaling server for Nextcloud Talk (https://github.com/strukturag/nextcloud-spreed-signaling).

The recording server only provides an HTTP API. It is expected that TLS termination will be provided by an additional component, like a reverse proxy.
